1. In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is.
The Javascript code style is a lot about keeping the code easy to read for others. It seems to be in some ways a forgiving code but it is importent to keep it clean and 
readable to avoid bugs and make it easy to understand and modify. The naming convention follows a camel style which makes it simpler to read and use later in the code when
there are multiple words. 

2. What is a Regular Expression?
   Regular expression or "Regex" is setting guidelines on what should be allowed for instance when a customer inserts billing details. You can choose which characters, numbers etc 
will be allowed to submit on a form.
